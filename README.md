# MakeACog
# This program demonstrates the use of Panda3D scene elements, particularly the use of DirectGUI, Actors, and Models via the creation of a cog model.
# Development for this project has taken about three weeks of on and off work, caused a couple of bumps along the way, created a few head scratches and frantic searches of Panda3D forums for answers, and ultimately established a greater sense of satisfaction, comfort, and understanding of the Panda3D engine.
# For future works, I am hoping this experience will hasten my skills.
# As of current, I've had issues trying to create .exe distributions for the project. As of current, the .exe will open a black Panda window, only to have it close after a second. The Panda manual didn't provide much diagnostic help, but the program runs from executing main.py in the CMD.
